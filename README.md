This is an introductory repository. Perhaps, as git notes, this is a good place for ideas.

Hello, my name is Timothy Spencer. I'm getting to be a pretty solid programmer with time, and 
it's very quickly becoming something I really enjoy as well. To tell you the truth, I am a 
definite hobbyist, and no doubt, though it is for my school and future work code is a nice hobby too. 
However, Don't be fooled, I enjoy a great many things. Specifically I play many musical 
instruments, and love to listen to all kinds of music as well. I do all types of creative stuff,
and enjoy puzzling etc. Also enjoy a good camping trip and adventuring, which subsequently breeds
a love of quadcopters. I've also been known to cook and play video games on occassion.
Overall these are a variety of things I enjoy.

About me on my life, I grew up in Rancho Cucamonga, CA. Enjoyed my time there, but seeing so much
of the US and even some other parts of the world, I've come to realize it is not the best or the 
worst, and I don't pledge allegiance to it. Currently residing in Boise Idaho, and love it, going 
to college at Boise State University. Love the city, the surroundings, and just about everything about
it. 

That's my location, but more personally, I have a lovely fiance I met in California, and am a strong 
family man. I have met many friends along the way, and look forward to who I meet ahead.

Some minor tidbits, I've been to China, and I used to be on Television at my school for a comedy TV
show. If you want to know more about this, or anything else I have more to tell. 

Lastly, I work at a company named CaptionCall which you may inquire about, however I am desperately 
seeking an internship to go into something I am studying, and really enjoy.

I feel I am a snowball, collecting information and personality as I roll through life,
maybe someday I'll be an ice-gollem of knowledge and personality. Before I'm off remember
no music is bad just different, and drive like you mean it, friends.
